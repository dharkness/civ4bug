<p class="style8">About Ethnic Artstyles </p>
<p>This mod is made to make the civilizations more culturally diverse with the available art made by freelance modders and unused art by Firaxis.</p>
<p><br>
  Basically, citysets of the different artstyle groups have been changed/altered until the Modern Era, where ever art was available for it. In some cases you'll still see the normal ingame cityset buildings, which means I haven't found art for those spots or I intended it to remain there. Also, for some units and buildings new .dds files are included which I felt made them look better without altering the basic model of it.</p>
<p><br>
  Besides citystyles, new palaces have been included for the different artstyles. This part is not finished yet since there's no art available for some artstyles/era's. 4 buildings (Granary, Forge, Aquaduct and Colosseum) switch to a new model from the industrial/modern era onwards. Couldn't let it work for an industrial airport at this stage.<br>
  </p>
<p>Included are Sepamu92's fishingboat modcomponent and the Ethnically Diverse Unit mod from a team chaired by White Rabbit.<br>
  </p>
<p>Changes were made on the shipscales which come with the EDU-mod. In general the late-era ships have been made smaller so they fit in a tile again. ;)</p>
<p>*Following taken from EDU Readme* </p>
<p>(This is the Beyond the Sword version of the Ethnically Diverse Units MOD (hence forth referred to as EDU BTS). If you're not familiar with the Ethnically Diverse Units MOD you can read a more detailed desription in the original thread. The only thing I will mention here is that - this mod does not in any way modify the gameplay, it is strictly a graphical modification.</p>
<p>As you may already be aware, the BTS expansion includes many ethnic units. However the units that appear in the game are only part of all the units that were made. All the units however are included on the CD, in other words, think of them as the lost units from vanilla - the resources are there but are not being used. This mod adds those units, 29 in total, to the game as well as a few more things.</p>
<p>All the ethnic units, other than those taken from Warlords scenarios and the BTS Charlemagne scenario, have been made by the EDU team, with guidance from the talented artists at Firaxis. </p>
<p>There are more than 50 new ethnic units, and altogether, with those taken from Warlords and Charlemagne, and some default/vanilla ones, they cover 16 units across 5 styles - European, Greco-Roman, Middle-Eastern, Asian and South American (aka Native).<br>
  The units that have ethnic styles are - Settler, Worker, Warrior, Scout, Archer, Spearman, Chariot, Horse Archer, Axeman, Swordsman, Longbowman, Crossbowman, Pikeman, Maceman, Knight and War Elephant.</p>
<p>In addition to the ethnic units, this mod also includes scale adjustments of naval units based on Elhoim's Better Ship Scale mod, plus minor scale adjustments to other units. As well as more interesting Settlers' &quot;formations&quot; with bigger families.)</p>
