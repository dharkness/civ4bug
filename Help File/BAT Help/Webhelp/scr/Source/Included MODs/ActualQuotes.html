<p> New to Beyond the Sword:</p>
<p>*All Hammurabi's quotes have been adapted from the &quot;Code of Hammurabi&quot;, a law text <br>
  commissioned by him and presented as his own words.</p>
<p>*Zara Yaqob's quotes are taken from &quot;The Chronicle of the Emperor Zara Yaqob&quot;.</p>
<p>*Suryavarman's one &quot;quote&quot; is an adaptation of the oath of allegiance required to be <br>
  taken by all Suryavarman's officials.</p>
<p>*Darius' few quotes are taken from the Bible.</p>
<p>*All Gilgamesh's quotes are lifted from the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. Many are shortened, <br>
  and some have been combined with other parts of the text in order to make better sense <br>
  in our context.</p>
<p>*Boudicca's quotes are taken entirely from various parts of Tacitus' rendition of <br>
  Boudicca's final battle cry.</p>
<p>*There are 617 glyphs in Pacal's tomb. Only some of these have been deciphered, and <br>
  Pacal's &quot;quote&quot; is taken from the current interpretation of the meaning of the <br>
  so-called &quot;shield glyph&quot;.</p>
<p> New to Warlords:</p>
<p>*Mehmed II's single &quot;quote&quot; is an invention (by me) based on the alleged promise the<br>
  sultan made to his men during the siege of Constantinople, that they could have &quot;the <br>
  women and the boys of the city&quot;.</p>
<p>*Most of Ragnar Lodbrok's quotes are taken from the saga &quot;The Last of the Volsungs&quot; as <br>
  translated by Donald Mackenzie. These quotes are thus rhyming verse. Ideally, quotes <br>
  would have been taken from the possibly more accurate &quot;The Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok and <br>
  his sons&quot; (&quot;Ragnars saga lo&eth;br&oacute;kar ok sona hans&quot;), however I have been unable to find <br>
  a translation of this text.</p>
<p>*There exist no quotes attributed to Shaka Zulu. Instead, I have used snippets from <br>
  a traditional Zulu &quot;praise song&quot; that has Shaka as its subject.</p>
<p>*The quotes for Ramesses II have been taken from a commemorative stela of the Ramesside <br>
  family located at Tanis; the stela commemorating the marriage between Ramesses II and <br>
  the daughter of the chief of Kheta; and from the peace treaty between Ramesses II and <br>
  the Hittite king Hattusili III.</p>
<p>*Wang Kon does not currently have any new text, as I have been unable to find even a <br>
  whisper of a quote attributed to him.</p>
<p> Original vanilla content:</p>
<p>*Quotes for Mansa Musa are taken from Al-Umari's description of Musa's visit to Cairo <br>
  in 1324.</p>
<p>*Quotes for Montezuma have been taken in part from the various Codices in which Aztec <br>
  eyewitness accounts are recorded, and in part from Cortez's own account of his meeting <br>
  with Montezuma.</p>
<p>*Note that the one quote used for Huayna Capac was in fact uttered by his son, Inca <br>
  Atahuallpa, to Fray Wincente Valverde.</p>
<p>*Most quotes for Asoka are taken from &quot;The Edicts of KingAshoka&quot;, a collection of <br>
  proclamations concerned mainly with social reform. They were apparently written in <br>
  Asoka's own words.</p>
<p>*Most quotes for Qin Shi Huang are taken from a stoneinscription on Mount Langya set <br>
  up to praise Qin and make his will clear. As few direct quotes exist, this was the <br>
  second best thing.</p>
<p>*The few quotes used for Cyrus are Biblical, as no othersource claiming to have his <br>
  exact words exist. The Bible quotes are probably mostly fiction too, but in this context<br>
  better than nothing.</p>
<p>*Quotes for Hatshepsut are taken from various Egyptian inscriptions made during her reign.<br>
</p>
<p> *All other leaders' quotes are from various sources around <br>
  the internet, and all are well known, even if some may be <br>
  apocryphal.</p>
