<title>What is The BUG Mod?</title>
</head>

<body>
<p><em><strong>BtS Unaltered  Gameplay</strong></em> <em><strong>Mod</strong></em> (<em><strong>BUG Mod</strong></em>) is a  modification for Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword. Civ4 is a very  easy game to modify, but not all modifications are compatible with  each other. In an effort to combine these many different mods from  the Civ4 community into one concise program, the BUG project was  born.</p>
<p> BUG combines mods  that do not change the basic game play of Civ4 while enhancing the  interface and improving ease of use. Some aspects that we feel are  within these criteria are Advisor Screens, the City Screen, the Main  View, the Civilopedia Screens, etc. Also, any additions or changes  made will not provide any information that cannot be figured out  within the game itself. </p>
<p>We feel this MOD is  safe for use in any Succession Game. If you find any changes  within the code that modify gameplay, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>, and we will  make it our priority to fix the problem.</p>
