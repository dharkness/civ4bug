<p ALIGN="LEFT" class="style4" LANG="en-US">About  Sevopedia</p>
<p LANG="en-US" ALIGN="LEFT">Greetings.   I love CIV, but we all know that they dropped the ball with the  civilopedia.  It's impossible to navigate easily and non-intuitive in  design.  So this is an improvement.  Sevo's Civilopedia  (or...Sevo-lo-pedia, or even Sevopedia, but I digress...)  This mod  turns the civilopedia into a nicer, user-friendly, easy-to-navigate  reference. - Sevo <BR>
</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT" class="style4" LANG="en-US">Features</p>
<ul>
  <li> Menus moved to left, with main menu on far left, sub-menu next to it.</li>
  <li> Main menu list reordered into groups with icons.</li>
  <li> Sub Menu organized into an easy to read list.</li>
  <li> No more hopping away from the top screen when you select a page.  The  page comes up in  the available to space on the right.</li>
  <li> Includes previously hidden entries (check out the barbarian  leader...)</li>
  <li> Will easily integrate with almost all existing mods.</li>
  <li> Vovan's Unit Upgrade Chart: Will automatically produce upgrade chart  for units, even when modded!</li>
  <li> Progor's Unit Promotion Chart: Will automatically produce promotion  chart, even when modded!</li>
  <li> Fitchn's Civilopedia Index: A simple alphabetical index to everything  in the Civilopedia, works in all five languages.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="LEFT" class="style4" LANG="en-US">Version  Info</p>
<ul>
  <li class="style5">2.3.2 (by BUG Mod) changed messed up leaderheads. </li>
  <li class="style5">2.3.1  (by LunarMongoose)</li>
  <li class="style5"> Fixed bug with Building links, which resulted from my trying to do  something clever at the last minute that didn't work</li>
  <li class="style5"> Fixed bug with Improvement links, which resulted from a simple typo  in the code</li>
  <li class="style5"> Fixed Back/Forward history omitter to not omit category selections  with no item list (ie Unit Upgrades, Promotion Tree, and Hints)</li>
  <li class="style5"> Fixed the item list so it has the correct item selected when jumping  to something via a button link, jumping to something via a text link,  using the Back/Forward buttons, and opening/closing the Pedia. This  was an unsolved problem until now; Gaurav's solution had been to use  a ListBox instead of a Table, but that prevents the display of icons  in the item list (which I really want to have). Note: It still  doesn't work when using a button link within the same category (e.g.  viewing a tech and clicking its &quot;Leads To:&quot; tech button).  This can only be fixed with some SDK tweaking (to the Widget  functions), and while I know how to do it I'm not going to bother due  to the pain of distributing SDK components.</li>
  <li class="style5"> Went ahead and added the Promotion Tree page</li>
  <li class="style5"> Added two icons from v.2.2 to the category list, for Promotions and  Civs/Leaders</li>
  <li class="style5"> Added a self.bSortLists flag to the top of CvPediaMain.py, for  alphabetical sorting of the item lists. The default value is True.  Not quite a configurable option yet, but you only have to edit the  files in one place to change it now, rather than two</li>
  <li class="style5">2.3  (by LunarMongoose)</li>
  <li class="style5"> Beyond the Sword versio</li>

  <li class="style5"> Does not include most v2.2 features, or Fitchn's Index, or any  customizability or options</li>
  <li class="style5"> Does not include a Promotion Upgrades page, would be easy to add but  I don't use it myself and was pressed for time</li>
  <li class="style5"> Individual panes now follow my own consistent GUI layout and look  much better than v1.93 and vanilla</li>
  <li class="style5"> Wonders are now seperated into National Wonder and Great Wonder  pages, with code to handle linking correctly</li>
  <li class="style5"> Back/Forward history now omits category-only selections that don't  show an entry in the main area, for faster/better history navigation</li>
  <li class="style5"> Keeps the Back/Forward buttons along the bottom as in vanilla, and  the title bar is no longer overriden to show selection names</li>
