- Varietas Delectat v3.1 (BtS 3.13) -
-------------------------------------
"Variety is the spice of life"

2007/nov/16

________________________________________________________________________________
DESCRIPTION

This little mod is based on the fabulous Ethnic Artstyles mod v1.07 and the
brilliant Ethnically Diverse Units MOD Beyond the Sword Edition v3.14
(with changes). Please see the readmes in Modules/Ethnic Artstyles/readme.

The aim of the mod is to create as ethnically diverse unit sets as possible,
to the extent that in most cases not only the cultural/racial groups were the
bases of these unit sets, but a single civilization.
As with projects of this scope, it's far from being perfect, and some/all
decisions of unit use can be(are?) questionable.
