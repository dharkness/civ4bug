Civ-Specific Great People for Beyond the Sword
Preliminary Release - July 18, 2007
By Gaius Octavius


This mod gives every civilization unique units for their great people so that each 
civ will have its own unique names instead of the original one list for all. 
There are close to 3,000 names for the 34 civilizations.

To install, simply extract the folder into Sid Meier's Civilization 4\Beyond the Sword\Mods\
and load using the "load a mod" option in the main menu.
