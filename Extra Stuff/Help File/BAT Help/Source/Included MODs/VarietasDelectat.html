<p class="style8">About Varietas Delectat </p>
<p class="style7">This little mod is based on the fabulous Ethnic Artstyles mod v1.09 and the  brilliant Ethnically Diverse Units MOD Beyond the Sword Edition v3.14  (with changes).     The aim of the mod is to create as ethnically diverse unit sets as possible,  to the extent that in most cases not only the cultural/racial groups were the  bases of these unit sets, but a single civilization.  As with projects of this scope, it's far from being perfect, and some/all  decisions of unit use can be (are?) questionable.</p>
