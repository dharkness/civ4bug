<P CLASS="style1">What is The BAT Mod?</P>
<P>The <span class="style4">BtS Artistic Tweaks (BAT Mod)</span> is a modification for <b><I>Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword</I></b>.</p> 

<P><i>Civilization IV</i> was designed to be extremely easy to modify, but not all modifications are compatible with each other. <BR>
In an effort to combine these many different mods from the <i>Civilization Community</i> into one concise program, 
the <b>BUG Project</b> was born.</P>

<P>The <b>BAT Mod</b> is an offshot of the original <b>BUG Mod</b>, including all the graphic and text changes 
(in particular those which allow to make each civilization as unique as they are in reality), 
which are not included into the <b>BUG Mod</b> due to their big size.<br>
On the other hand, to make the install process as easy as possible, 
the <b><i>BUG Team</i></b> includes into the <b>BAT Mod</b> setup file also the full <b>BUG Mod</b> pack, thanks to its small size.</P>

<P>The <b>BAT Mod</b> combines mods that do not change the basic game play of <i>Civ4</i> while enhancing its look and easy of use. 
Also, any additions or changes  made will not provide any information that cannot be figured out within the game itself.<br>
We feel this mod is safe for use in any <i>Succession Game</i>, but all players will have to run it from the 
<i>'..\My Games\Beyond the Sword\Mods'</i> folder. 
If you find any changes within the code that modify gameplay, please <A HREF="contact.html">contact us</A>,  
and we will make it our priority to fix the problem.</P>

<P>The best way to understand the <b>BAT Mod</b>, anyway, is to download the 
<A HREF="http://civ4bug.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">latest version</A> and to try it.</P>
