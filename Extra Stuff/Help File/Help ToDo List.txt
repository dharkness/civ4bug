BUG Mod
=======

- Create mod files (readmes) for Sevopedia additions:
    index, shortcuts, traits, strategy articles
- Help files for PublicMaps (no documentation about them yet)



BAT Mod
=======

- DEU BAT Help is in English (in almost all pages, nothing to do or only to change "BUG" with "BAT" in BUG localized files and use them to overwrite the English one, IncludedMods.html need  some additional trannslation and there are some readme to be translated for mod included only in BAT)
