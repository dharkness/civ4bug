<P CLASS="style1">Military Advisor</P>
<P CLASS="style3">by Ruff_hi &amp; EmperorFool</P>
<br>
<P>The Military Advisor is now divided into two sections, <b>'Deployment'</b> and <b>'Sit-Rep'</b> (or <i>Situation Report</i>).<br>
The <b>Deployment Tab</b> makes finding units easier by grouping units by location and unit type.<br>
The <b>Sit-Rep Tab</b> is your all-in-one spot to find information related to your military diplomacy.</P>
<P>This tab displays the follow information for each known Civ (from left to right):
<ul>
  <li>the icon of the Civilization's Leader</li>
  <li>a fist indicating that the Civilization &quot;Has Enough on Their Hands&quot;, 
      which usually means they are planning, or are engaged in a war that is taking all their resources</li>
  <li>the icon of the Civilzation's Worst Enemy</li>
  <li>the Threat Indicator, which gives you a rough idea what the threat level of attack from that Civilization is towards you</li>
  <li>Strategic Advantages, both yours and the other Civilizations: this is useful so you don't go attacking rifles with swordsman!</li>
  <li>icons of Leaders which are at war (or will probably be at war soon) with that Civ</li>
  <li>an indicator showing that the Civilization is a Vassal State of another Civ</li>
  <li>an indicator showing that the Civilization has a Defensive Pact with another Civ</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Threat Indicator</b><br><br>
The Threat Indicator is a crude, five-levels indicator based on a percentile <b>Threat Index</b> as follows:
<UL>
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Low Risk</FONT>: Threat Index less than 15% 
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Guarded Risk</FONT>: Threat Index more than or equal to 15% but less than 35%
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Elevated Risk</FONT>: Threat Index more than or equal to 35% but less than 55%
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">High Risk</FONT>: Threat Index more than or equal to 55% but less than 75%
	<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Severe Risk</FONT>: Threat Index more than or equal to 75%
</UL>
The Threat Index is made up of two major components with some adjustments.<br>
The first component is the <b>Relationship</b>: it is based on the pluses and minuses from the AI attitude and is capped at -15 and +15; 
there are 38 points which are allocated to this component with +15 attitude corresponding to 0 points and 
-15 attitude corresponding to 38 points (linear between -15 to -15).<br>
The second component is the <b>Power</b>: it is based on the power ratio (power from the demographic charts) 
of our power divided by the AI power; it is capped at 0.5 and 1.5, so there are 38 points are allocated to this component 
with 1.5 power ratio corresponding to 0 points and 0.5 power corresponding to 38 points (linear between 1.5 to 0.5).
If the Civ's power is not know (i.e. because not enough espionage points), then this component is estimated at 28.5 (38 * 0.75) 
and <b>"est"</b> is added to the Level.<br>
About <b>Adjustments</b>, 
if you have a Defensive Pact with the AI, then the Threat Index is multiplied by 0.2;
if the AI is in WHEOOH mode and not at war (i.e. planning for war), then the Threat Index is multiplied by 1.3.
<br><br>
<p><b>Strategic Advantages</b><br><br>
Any military unit that you can build (tech and required resource) and the AI cannot (including any possible upgrade) 
is a strategic advantage to you; the same applies to the AI.<br>
For example: If you can build knights and the AI can build horse archers, you have a strategic advantage (Knight) 
and the AI doesn't (your knight cancels out the horse archer even though you cannot build it as the horse archer upgrades to a knight).<br>
The strategic Advantage information is primarily non-domestic unit based 
(workers, settlers, missionaries, corporate execs, spies, etc are excluded). 
The information required is tech and resource knowledge; if you don't have this information, then the cancel icon is displayed. 
Unique Units are a strategic advantage and are not canceled by the regular unit.
