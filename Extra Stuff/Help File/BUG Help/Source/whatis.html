(<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I><B>BUG Mod</B></I></FONT>) is a
modification for <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>Civilization IV: Beyond the
Sword</I></FONT>. Civilization 4 was designed to be extremely easy to
modify, but not all modifications are compatible with each other. In
an effort to combine these many different mods from the Civilization
Community into one concise program, The BUG Project was born.</P>
<P>BUG combines mods that do not change the basic game play of
Civilization 4 while enhancing the interface and improving ease of
use. Some aspects that we feel are within these criteria are Advisor
Screens, the City Screen, the Main View, the Civilopedia Screens,
etc. Also, any additions or changes made will not provide any
information that cannot be figured out within the game itself. 
</P>
<P>We feel this MOD is safe for use in any Succession Game. If you
find any changes within the code that modify gameplay, please <A HREF="contact.html">contact
us</A>, and we will make it our priority to fix the problem.</P>
<P>Download the <A HREF="http://civ4bug.sourceforge.net/">Latest
Version</A> here.</P>
