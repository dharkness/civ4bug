[TAB]This is another new trait introduced by the Warlords expansion pack, and doesn’t seem to be very well-thought out. The fact that I consider this one of the weakest traits should not come as a surprise, since that’s an opinion shared by most players—though I grant that Protective does have its fans.

*** How to Use It

While Protective is weak, it isn’t without its uses. When you capture a city, your freely-promoted units are better equipped to defend your new possession, which is highly likely to come under a counter-attack. In fact, your gunpowder units can potentially perform double-duty as both attackers and defenders. (Most archery units, however, are weak attackers and are best used on defense only.)
[TAB]If you have a source of stone, the walls and castles are even cheaper, making them less of a burden to build. Combined with wonders like the Temple of Artemis and the Great Lighthouse, you could make Protective’s cheap castles part of a trade route economy, which can be very helpful in the mid-game period. You can also use the cheap castles to supplement espionage in BtS. In fact, some players have begun playing an EP, or “Espionage Economy”, where the science slider is turned down to 0% after Alphabet and most remaining technologies are acquired through tech-stealing.
[TAB]The civilization that probably benefits the most from the trait is China, because its UU is one of the best Archery units in the game—the Cho-Ko-Nu, which can and should be used as an attacking unit. Drill I just enhances its power, giving it an additional first strike chance beyond its 2 free first strikes.

*** The Downside

The problem with the Protective trait is that it’s largely defensive in nature. The free City Garrison promotion is only useful when units are under attack while in a city. Walls and castles—which are pretty cheap to begin with, making their double production speed less appealing—are likewise only useful when you’re under attack. Only the free Drill I promotion is an attacking promotion, but how often do you attack with archery units? Unless they’re Cho-Ko- Nus, of course. (Though it can be beneficial to your more aggressive gunpowder units.)
[TAB]The problem with playing defensively in Civilization IV is that the AI is so fond of pillaging. If your units cower behind city walls, the AI will gleefully send your economy spiraling down into ruin by pillaging every tile improvement in sight. Your units have to venture out of your cities to defend your territory, which makes walls and castles next to useless—ditto with the City Garrison promotion.
[TAB]In many ways, the Protective trait seems to have been added more to benefit the AI than the human player. The AI prefers to play defensively for the most part, so Protective suits its programming. Any human player will tell you that going up against Protective Longbowmen, fortified in a city on a hill with a castle and walls, can be intimidating—though certainly not insurmountable. Just bring more Trebuchets to the party.
