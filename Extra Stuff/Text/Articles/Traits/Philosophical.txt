[TAB]Just as the Financial trait lends itself to the Commerce Economy, the Philosophical trait lends itself to the Specialist Economy (SE). The SE, of course, has many adherents, and the debate over which economy is best rages on.
[TAB]Suffice it to say that the SE is strongest in the hands of a Philosophical leader, since running all those specialists will result in many more Great People. You don't have to run a SE with a Philosophical leader, just as you can run a CE without the Financial trait, but the SE and the Philosophical trait are both at their strongest when combined.
[TAB]Great People have many uses, of course. In the Specialist Economy, they are principally used for "lightbulbing", that is, using the Great Person to discover a technology, usually research-free. You can then trade this "free technology" for techs you need from other civilizations. This allows you to run the research slider at 0% for most of the game while you rely on a combination of scientists and tech trades to keep up in research. (My version of the SE in a nutshell.)

*** How to Use It

I won't go into the details on how to run a SE, because that's beyond the scope of this article. Let's just say my recommendation with the Philosophical trait is to run a SE or at least a "hybrid economy" where some cities focus on food and specialists and others focus on cottages and commerce. (A hybrid economy is especially suitable for Elizabeth of England, who has the Financial trait that, as mentioned above, requires a certain amount of cottage spam to take full advantage of it.)
[TAB]Within the SE community, opinions differ as to the importance of building the Pyramids. The appeal of the Pyramids to a SE is to run the Representation civic extremely early in the game. This civic raises the happiness cap of your five largest cities on a standard-sized map (which are probably your only cities early on). This allows you to grow those cities even larger so you can work more farms and run more specialists. In addition, every specialist contributes an additional three research points under Representation beyond whatever research points they normally contribute--even those that normally don't contribute any research, such as engineers, priests, merchants, and ordinary citizen specialists. The science contribution of artists and spies goes up from 1 to 4 under representation, while the contribution of scientists doubles from 3 to 6. Obviously the Pyramids and early Representation hyper-charge the SE, but many maintain the SE can get along without either the wonder or the civic.
[TAB]The Parthenon can also be a useful wonder to a Philosophical leader. You're already relying on Great People for technologies, so why not build a wonder that increases the number of GP you'll get?
[TAB]Writing will be an early priority technology so you can build libraries and run your first scientists. Wonders can be very useful since they all contribute GP points; go after the wonders that contribute GPP towards the types of Great People you most want and need. Since Great Scientists are usually the most useful GPs, that makes the Great Library a very attractive wonder for leaders with the Philosophical trait. Mercantilism contributes a free specialist for each city, as does the Statue of Liberty (and without the "no foreign trade routes" price of Mercantilism). The Caste System civic is a huge boon to the SE and the Philosophical trait, allowing you to run as many merchants, scientists, and/or artists as a city can support. Therefore Code of Laws is a priority technology. Education enables the Philosophical trait's cheap building, the University, so that's a priority as well. Philosophy makes the Pacifism civic available, which provides a further +100% boost to GP production in cities that have your state religion. Biology will allow you to grow larger cities and support more specialists, so prioritize that tech later in the game.
[TAB]The National Park national wonder benefits the SE as it allows 1 free specialist for every forest preserve. It means, though, that you have to be careful to preserve some forests or even jungles in the fat cross of the city where you build it.

*** The Downside

Running a specialist economy requires a great deal more micro-management than running the more-straightforward cottage economy. The game will take longer to play and you'll need to manage everything much more closely. That style of play doesn't suit everyone.
[TAB]The benefits of the Philosophical trait and of the SE begin to peter out in the late game. Great People get more expensive to produce and appear less frequently, while technologies become too expensive for your specialists and fewer Great People to research efficiently. You had better be in a position to win by this point or you may quickly find yourself falling behind. Either that, or you will need to transition to a cottage economy; a switch to the Emancipation civic will be essential to pulling this off.
[TAB]Unlike the Financial trait, the Philosophical trait does not provide any direct economic benefits. You'll need to look for other ways to keep your economy afloat.
