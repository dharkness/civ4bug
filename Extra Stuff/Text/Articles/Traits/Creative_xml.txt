[TAB]Creative is powerful early in the game, allowing you to quickly expand your borders and thereby claim territory and resources. The Warlords 2.08 patch added cheap Libraries, one of the best buildings in the game, making this trait even better.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_WRITING]Writing[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_DRAMA]Drama[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_CONSTRUCTION]Construction[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET] n/a[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Library[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_THEATRE]Theatre[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_COLOSSEUM]Colosseum[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=CIVIC_FREE_SPEECH]Free Speech[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]The big benefit Creative provides is allowing you more freedom in your city placement and in your early city builds. You don't have to worry about placing a city so a crucial resource is in its first ring of workable tiles so you can access it right away; it will be workable within a few short turns of founding the city. You can also skip monuments, Stonehenge, and spreading a religion (well, you can be a little more relaxed about the latter, at least).[NEWLINE][TAB]In addition, Creative may allow you to win some early game tug-o-war battles with a nearby civ over a key resource tile. By the same token, if the map lends itself to it, you can use the trait to seal off territory at a choke point. Creative is also something of a defensive trait, a cousin to Protective. By expanding your borders earlier and infusing the tiles with your culture, you have more territory that the enemy has to trudge through to attack you. It's also harder for another civilization to take tiles from you by city placement or by conquering cities. Creative also raises the cultural defense of a city faster, making it tougher to conquer.[NEWLINE][TAB]Writing enables the trait's cheap libraries, so it's obviously an even more important tech than before. The cheap theatres and coliseums may or may not be useful, depending on your strategy and circumstances in the game. You may want to warmonger in the mid or late game to get your most out of these buildings, using them to decrease war weariness.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]Creative is a trait that is extremely useful in the early game and gets weaker as the game goes on. The +2[ICON_CULTURE] becomes less and less of a factor as the game progresses and more methods of producing culture accrue in each city. Also, the cheap buildings are available early and are all relatively cheap to begin with, so their faster production times will be less noticeable later in the game. By the middle of most games, the Creative trait is mostly a non-factor.
