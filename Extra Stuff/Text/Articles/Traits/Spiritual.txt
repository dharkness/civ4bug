[TAB]As with Financial, Spiritual's great strength comes from its positive impact on your economy. Anarchy means that for one turn or more, your cities do not grow or build anything, your culture does not increase, GPP are not accumulated, cottages do not grow, and so on. Spiritual means you avoid those periods of economic stasis; this should result in your being able to research at least one or two additional technologies, build several more units and buildings, produce more Great People, and so on, compared to a non-Spiritual civ.
[TAB]Unlike several other traits, Spiritual's effects do not decrease later in the game. On the contrary, as more civics and religions become available, you may want and need to change civics more often, and Spiritual lets you do so.
[TAB]However, this trait has slipped, in my opinion, from being one of the strongest to being a medium-strength trait. This is mainly because of the Beyond the Sword expansion pack. Frankly, many disputed my inclusion of it in the "Strong" category to begin with. But Beyond the Sword has reduced its strength by making its effects easier to obtain. You now only need to use one Great Person, not two, in order to bring about your first Golden Age; and you can now change civics anarchy-free during a Golden Age. This is just one of many was that Golden Ages have been improved and made more attractive in Beyond the Sword.
[TAB]Furthermore, in the late game, when you have access to all the civics and Spiritual is normally at its strongest, you can now achieve the same effects by building the new Cristo Redentor wonder, which not only gives you Spiritual's ability to change civics anarchy-free; you can also change civics without having to wait for a single turn change, let alone the usual five! (Note: in the BtS 3.13 patch, this has been changed to a 1 turn waiting period between civics changes.)
[TAB]So Spiritual, to my mind, has fallen from strong to medium not through any fault of its own, but through easier access to its benefits to non-Spiritual leaders.

*** How to Use It

No anarchy means you can adopt a civic right now, as soon as it's available, and gain its advantages immediately, rather than waiting to change several civics at once as a prudent non-Spiritual leader would do. So if a civic would benefit you, don't hesitate to switch to it. The only restraint you have is waiting five turns until you can change civics again.
[TAB]There are also diplomatic benefits. You can easily convert to a religion or change to a favoured civic to court another civilization. Once you gain what you need from them--say, a tech trade--you can convert religions or civics back just as easily. However, do keep in mind that diplomatic bonuses for shared religions or favoured civics can take several turns to accumulate to a significant level.
[TAB]The Pyramids are an attractive wonder for a Spiritual leader, since they enable all the government civics early on, letting you leverage the trait early in the game. Obviously, any tech that enables a civic is valuable and should be prioritized--provided the civic is worthwhile. In Beyond the Sword, the Shwedagon Paya is also attractive, since it's the religious equivalent of the Pyramids, enabling all religious civics.
[TAB]Temples are modest buildings, producing +1 culture and keeping one citizen happy. However, Spiritual's cheap temples can truly shine if you build the Spiral Minaret (enabled by Divine Right), the University of Sankore (Paper), and the Apostolic Palace (Theology). These wonders make the temples of your state religion produce +1 gold, +2 research, and +2 hammers, respectively. (Please note that if you don't build the AP, you can still get its +2 hammer boost for all religious buildings by adopting the AP religion as your state religion.) Just be aware that building one or more of these wonders makes the Free Religion civic unappealing, and lowers the priority of Computers and Mass Media, which obsolete the wonders.

*** The Downside

Spiritual is the inverse of a trait like Creative: it is very weak early in the game when there are few civics available. Its benefits come later as more civics come on line. Realistically, most of your civics changes will occur in the mid-game, though obviously this can vary, but in most games I find myself taking less advantage of the Spiritual trait in the late game.
[TAB]In addition, while Spiritual may allow you to "save money", unlike Financial, the trait it doesn't directly produce any. You'll need to have a sound economy, as usual.
[TAB]You may be tempted, when playing as a Spiritual leader, to switch to any civic as soon as it's available. Remember that some civics have high maintenance costs compared to others; ensure the civic is worthwhile in some respect before changing. Also remember that just because a civic is made available, that doesn't mean it's necessarily optimal for you at that point in the game. Consider your choices carefully and make sure your civics fit into your overall strategy and the circumstances within the game.
[TAB]To gain the benefits of the cheap temples, you need a state religion. You'll therefore need to either found a religion or have one spread to you. In addition, you may need or want to adopt a state religion very early on, and that may have diplomatic repercussions for you.
