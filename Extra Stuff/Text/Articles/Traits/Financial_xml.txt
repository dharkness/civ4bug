[TAB]This is quite probably the strongest of the traits, at least at levels below Emperor, so much so that many players consider Financial to be a "crutch" and avoid leaders with this trait because they feel it offers an unfair advantage. The game developers apparently agreed, hence in one of the early patches they removed the double production speed of banks to lessen its power. Even so, Financial remains a truly awesome trait.[NEWLINE][TAB]At first, it seems so subtle: +1[ICON_COMMERCE] on some tiles? So what?[NEWLINE][TAB]The answer, of course, is this: It's the economy, stupid. Say what you want about military, research, religion, and other game elements; ultimately, your civilization requires a robust economy in order to support everything else you do. Military units incur maintenance costs, more so if they're outside of your territory. Cities likewise have maintenance costs, hampering your rate of expansion and requiring you to ensure each city can somehow pay for itself. And to keep up in technology you have to be able to set aside funds to support research. The Financial trait makes all of these tasks a little easier--if handled well, a lot easier.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]High-Priority Technologies[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_POTTERY]Pottery[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_CURRENCY]Currency[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_GUILDS]Guilds[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_BANKING]Banking[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_LIBERALISM]Liberalism[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_PRINTING_PRESS]Printing Press[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_DEMOCRACY]Democracy[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=TECH_CORPORATION]Corporation[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Wonders[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_COLOSSUS]The Colossus[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_WALL_STREET]Wall Street[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Best Buildings[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_MARKET]Market[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_GROCER]Grocer[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_BANK]Bank[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_LIBRARY]Library[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_UNIVERSITY]University[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_OBSERVATORY]Observatory[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=BUILDING_LABORATORY]Laboratory[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]Useful Civics[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=CIVIC_FREE_SPEECH]Free Speech[\LINK][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET] [LINK=CIVIC_EMANCIPATION]Emancipation[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1][H1]How to Use It[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]The main way to leverage the financial trait is very straightforward: cottage spam. Yes, the tried-and-true Cottage Economy, or CE. Have your [LINK=UNIT_WORKER]Workers[\LINK] lay down as many [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_COTTAGE]cottages[\LINK] as your population can work while still working other worthwhile tiles as well. I'm especially fond of placing cottages on riverside grassland tiles, as the Financial benefit kicks in as soon as the cottage is built, and the 2 food feeds the citizen working the tile (floodplains, with 3 food, are even better for cottages, supporting city growth along with the economy). Just remember you may have to irrigate some of those tiles instead, by placing farms on them, in order to feed and grow your population and/or to chain irrigate another tile. Make sure you have citizens working the cottages steadily, however, as it's the only way to make them grow and increase their revenue.[NEWLINE][TAB]In addition, be on the lookout for resources that provide additional commerce. Gems, gold, and silver are obvious targets, but spices, silk, and wine are good as well; all will earn you the +1[ICON_COMMERCE] benefit in addition to the additional commerce of the resource. You want to claim these resources, ensure they're in a city's fat cross, and are improved and then worked by a citizen. Most of the commerce-rich resources also increase happiness, which means you can grow your other cities larger and, in turn, work more cottages and other commerce-rich tiles.[NEWLINE][TAB]Since you'll have all that extra commerce rolling in, prioritize buildings that do something with it, and the technologies that enable them. Libraries, monasteries, universities, observatories, and laboratories all multiply the amount of research you convert from commerce via the science slider, while markets, grocers, and banks multiply whatever gold is left over. In addition, Printing Press will increase the yield from your cottage investment, as will the Free Speech civic. Emancipation will make any immature cottages grow faster.[PARAGRAPH:1][H1]The Downside[\H1][PARAGRAPH:1]First off, Financial provides no direct benefit to a tile that isn't providing at least 2 commerce. This can make you reluctant to work tiles without the benefit, even though you will need to. This means a production city, which mostly works hammer-rich rather than commerce-rich tiles, gains no direct benefit from the trait. You will, however, need at least one production city, preferably more, so don't overlook them in favour of commerce cities. The same goes for tile improvements. Yes, you can place a cottage on a grassland hill. But should you? A mine would provide much-needed hammers, something commerce cities often chronically lack.[NEWLINE][TAB]The biggest problem with Financial, however, is the vulnerability of your economy, especially as time goes on. It takes a lot of turns to make a cottage grow into a town, but that investment can be quickly undone by a couple of pillaging enemy units. And the not-inconsiderable amount of gold to be gained from pillaging cottages is very tempting to the AI. You will need to garrison your best, oldest commerce cities with anti-pillaging units if you go to war. Also try to have your best commerce cities inland at the heart of your empire, rather than on the more vulnerable borders or coastline.
