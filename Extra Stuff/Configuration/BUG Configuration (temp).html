  <b>BTS UNALTERED GAMEPLAY </b><br>
  <b>Version 2.1 </b><br>
  <br>
  <br>
BUG comprises a vast array of new items.  The main feature and over-riding approach that every element <br>
added had to provide no additional information that is not available in the unmodified BtS game.  That is, <br>
there is no alteration to the basic game play. All BUG features are optional, that is, the modifications that <br>
BUG brings to the game can be turned off.   <br>
The  BtS  Unaltered  Gameplay  files  would  be  stored  in  the  ,,C:\Documents  and  Settings\user\My <br>
Documents\My Games\Beyond the Sword\. <br>

<b>LOGGING </b><br>
The BUG mod includes a logging portion that logs the general events that occur in the game to a text file. <br>
This is mainly included for succession game (SG) players as a way of recording the mundane events that <br>
occur. Typically, SG players / events have house rules concerning the use (or otherwise) of loggers. <br>
The options shown on the BUG mods logging option screen are shown below. <br>
 <br>
These features are discussed below. <br>
  <b>Enable Logging </b><br>
If this options is checked, then the logging portion of BUG is enabled and logging will occur. <br>
  <b>Silent Start </b><br>
This option means that logging of the game will automatically start and the file name will be set to the <br>
name  of  the  player.  In  the  above  graphic,  the  game  was  started  by  the  player  ,,Ruff_Hi  and  the <br>
logging will be written to a file ,,Ruff_Hi.txt that is in the default file path (my docs\BtS\autolog). <br>
  <b>Color Coding </b><br>
If color coding is checked, then the log will include various color characteristics that group the events <br>
being logged by color. The user cannot adjust the colors. <br>
  <b>4000BC is turn ? </b><br>

they wish to use. <br>

If  this  option  is  checked,  then  the  logger  will include  a line  that  contains  "IBT:"  (IBT  stands  for  "In <br>
between Turns") at the conclusion of the players turn and prior to the AIs turns. <br>
  <b>Use Default File Name</b> <br>
If ,,Silent Start is not checked, then the player must start the logger manually. The key to start the <br>
logger  is  Alt-L.  If  the  ,,Use  Default  File  Name  option  is  checked,  then  the  default  name  (Players <br>
Name) is used for the text file. If the ,,Use Default File Name option is not checked, then the player <br>
must supply a file name via an input box. <br>
  <b>Path</b> <br>
The player can override the default path for the location of the logging file. <br>
  <b>File</b> <br>

<b>UNIT NAMING </b><br>
The BUG mod includes the <b>Generic Unit Naming</b> (GUN) mod. This mod is designed to give the player an <br>
extremely flexible method of naming his units. The basic approach is that the player constructs a naming <br>
convention that he want to use (see later) and then assigns that naming convention to all units, all units <br>
of the same combat type or all units of the same unit type in the same era. <br>
The options shown on the BUG mods Unit Naming option screen are shown below. <br>
 <br>
These features are discussed below: <br>
  <b>Enabled </b><br>
If this option is checked, then the unit naming portion of BUG is enabled and units produced will be <br>
given a name depending on the player defined naming convention.  If this option is not checked, then <br>
the unit naming portion of BUG is not enabled and default Civ4 unit naming will occur. <br>
  <b>Use Advanced </b><br>
If checked, than the unit naming code will extract the naming convention from the BUG Mod.ini using <br>
the  unit  type  and  the  current  player  era.  If  this  naming  convention  is  "DEFAULT",  then  the  naming <br>
convention  associated  with  the  units  combat  type  will  be  used.  If  this  naming  convention  is <br>
"DEFAULT", then the ,,default naming convention will be used. <br>
For example: An axe constructed in the ancient era will use the naming convention stored with the ini <br>
key  "AXE_ANCIENT".    If  this  naming  convention  is  "DEFAULT",  then  the  naming  convention  stored <br>
with  the  ini  key  "Melee"  will  be  used.  If  this  naming  convention  is  "DEFAULT",  then  the  naming <br>
convention stored with the ini key "DEFAULT" will be used. <br>
<hr>
<A name=22></a>If this option is not checked, then the naming convention associated with the units combat type will <br>
be used. If this naming convention is "DEFAULT", then the ,,default naming convention will be used. <br>
The screen also shows the various naming conventions used for the 10 combat types in the game. An 11th <br>
quasi-combat type (None) has been added for settlers, workers, missionaries, etc.  <br>
The following is the code that controls the name that your unit will have. <br>
o  <b>^civ4^ </b><br>
no naming convention, uses standard civ4<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^rd^ </b><br>
random name<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^rc^</b> <br>
random civ related name<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^ct^</b> <br>
city<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^cv^</b> <br>
civilization<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^ut^</b> <br>
unit<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^cb^</b> <br>
combat type<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^dm^</b> <br>
domain<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^ld^</b> <br>
leader<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^cnt[f]^</b> <br>
count across all units<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^cntu[f]^</b> <br>
count across same unit<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^cntct[f]^</b> <br>
count across same city<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^cntuct[f]^</b> <br>
count across same unit/city<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^cntc[f]^</b> <br>
count across same combat type<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^cntd[f]^</b> <br>
count across same domain<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^tt1[f][x:y]^</b>  total where the total is a random number between x and y<b> </b><br>
o  <b>^tt2[f][x]^</b> <br>
total count (starts at x, incremented by 1 each time ^tt1 is reset to 1)<b> </b><br>
There are a lot of number formats; [f] can be: <br>
o  <b>'s'</b> <br>
for silent (not shown)<b> </b><br>
o  <b>'A'</b> <br>
for upper case alpha (A, B, C, D, ...)<b> </b><br>
o  <b>'a'</b> <br>
for lower case alpha (a, b, c, d, ...)<b> </b><br>
o  <b>'p'</b> <br>
for phonetic (alpha, bravo, charlie, delta, ...)<b> </b><br>
o  <b>'g'</b> <br>
for greek (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, ...)<b> </b><br>
o  <b>'n'</b> <br>
for number (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)<b> </b><br>
o  <b>'o'</b> <br>
for ordinal (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ...)<b> </b><br>
o  <b>'r'</b> <br>
for roman (I, II, III, IV, ...)<b> </b><br>
Some number formats have a built in max (i.e. alpha); in these situations, the numbering loops back to <br>
the start. For example, if you pass the number ,,30 and ask for the number to be formatted with an ,,A <br>
(upper case alpha) then it will return ,,D. <br>
